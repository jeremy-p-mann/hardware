# Storage

<!-- Be as concise and precise as possible, maintaining a technical, rigorous, scientific tone -->

Provides non-volatile storage for system data and applications, meaning data is retained even when the system is powered off.

## Parameters

<!-- every section should explain what the parameter is, some typical ranges,
and pros/cons changes as you vary the parameter -->

### Capacity

Storage capacity refers to the amount of data that can be stored on a device, critical for determining how many applications, files, and media can be accommodated.

#### Typical Values

- **256GB**: Suitable for basic use, including operating systems and essential applications.
- **512GB**: Balances cost and space, ideal for everyday computing needs.
- **1TB and above**: Suitable for users requiring extensive storage for large applications and multimedia files.

#### Pros and Cons

- **Higher Capacity Pros**:
  - Enables storage of large volumes of data, beneficial for media creators and data-intensive applications.
  - Reduces the need for external storage solutions.

- **Higher Capacity Cons**:
  - Increased cost with larger storage amounts.
  - Risk of data loss if not regularly backed up.

### Form Factor

Form factor indicates the physical dimensions of the storage device, impacting compatibility with various systems.

#### Typical Values

- **2.5-inch**: Common for many laptops and desktops.
- **M.2**: Compact form factor, often used in laptops and desktops for SSDs.
- **3.5-inch**: Typically used in desktop systems and servers.

#### Pros and Cons

- **M.2 Pros**:
  - Smaller size allows for compact system builds.
  - Versatile installations in a wide range of systems.

- **M.2 Cons**:
  - May require specific motherboard support.
  - Potentially higher cost compared to traditional 2.5-inch drives.

### Interface

The interface refers to the connection type between the storage device and the motherboard, affecting data transfer speeds and compatibility.

#### Typical Values

- **SATA III**: Up to 6 Gbps transfer rates, widely supported.
- **PCIe NVMe**: Offers significantly higher transfer rates, exceeding 32 Gbps.

#### Pros and Cons

- **PCIe NVMe Pros**:
  - Dramatically faster data transfer rates compared to SATA.
  - Ideal for speed-intensive applications, such as gaming or video editing.

- **PCIe NVMe Cons**:
  - Requires motherboard compatibility.
  - Higher cost than SATA solutions.

### Technology

Storage technology determines underlying mechanisms of data storage, impacting speed, durability, and cost.

#### Typical Values

- **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Mechanical storage, cost-effective with large capacities.
- **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Faster access times, using flash memory, with no moving parts.
- **Hybrid Drives**: Combine HDD and SSD components for balanced performance and cost.

#### Pros and Cons

- **SSD Pros**:
  - Faster read/write speeds improve system boot times and overall responsiveness.
  - More reliable and durable due to lack of moving parts.

- **SSD Cons**:
  - Generally more expensive per GB than HDDs.
  - Limited write-cycle lifespan, although improving with technology advancements.
